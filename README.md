Spark Project 
========================================================

This constitutes a segment of a project undertaken as part of the [master's course](https://www.di.uoa.gr/studies/graduate) at the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications at the University of Athens. 
Specific details regarding the course can be accessed [here](https://www.di.uoa.gr/sites/default/files/documents/grad/grad_cs_courses/%CE%9C111%20%CE%94%CE%B9%CE%B1%CF%87%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%B7%20%CE%9C%CE%B5%CE%B3%CE%AC%CE%BB%CF%89%CE%BD%20%CE%94%CE%B5%CE%B4%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%AD%CE%BD%CF%89%CE%BD.pdf), along with a corresponding description.

### What is Spark?

Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It provides high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames, pandas API on Spark for pandas workloads, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Structured Streaming for stream processing.
